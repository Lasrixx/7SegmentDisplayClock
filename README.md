# 7SegmentDisplayClock
Small Arduino project that uses the DS1307 real-time clock component and 4-digit 7-segment display to create a clock. It also uses the 74HC595 Shift Register to connect the display to the Arduino.


If the Arduino were battery-powered instead of powered off a computer then this project would effectively be a real digital clock!
